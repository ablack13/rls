## DAILY SCHEDULE

---

### **08:00–08:30 AM — Listening + Shadowing**

  - [Viața în România — Vloguri](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=via%C8%9Ba+în+românia+vlog)
- Pick **1–2 min** segment → Shadow every sentence (intonation + rhythm).

**Tue/Thu/Sat/Sun**
- TV show excerpts with clear situations (family, markets, travel):
  - Search: “Emisiune culinară România” or “Reportaj România TV”
- Watch twice: 1st for visuals only, 2nd with Romanian subtitles if available.

---

### **13:30–14:00 PM — Reading + Noticing**
**Daily**
- Short news or blog posts on *very familiar topics* (weather, food, daily life):
  - [Radio România Junior News](https://www.radioromaniacultural.ro/)  
  - [Simple blog posts in Romanian](https://www.gustos.ro/)
- Skim for meaning from context.
- Highlight 5 repeating phrases — say them aloud (no translation).

---

### **18:00–19:00 PM — Deep Listening-Reading**
**Weeks 9–10**
- Choose a 5–8 min YouTube documentary or travel segment:
  - [HaiHui în doi](https://www.youtube.com/c/HaiHuiÎnDoi) (Romanian travel vlog)
  - Watch → read transcript (if available) → watch again.
- Retell in Romanian with as many details as possible.

**Weeks 11–12**
- Move to podcast excerpts with strong storytelling:
  - [Podcast Pe Bune (DoR)](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=podcast+pe+bune)
  - Listen in chunks (3–4 min) → re-listen after checking any missed key points visually or with transcript.
- Keep retelling aloud.

---

### **21:30–22:00 PM — Review + Speaking**
**Daily**
- Listen to *România Actualități* or a slow podcast for 10–15 min:
  - Focus on catching known phrases, not every word.
- 5–10 min: Summarize your day or one video you saw — aim for connected sentences.
- Passive listening while relaxing before sleep.

---

## WEEKLY REVIEW LOOP
- Keep **Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 7 → Day 30** review cycle.
- Keep image-based SRS slides — by now you’ll have 150–200 images.
- When reviewing, close eyes and **visualize the scene** while saying the phrase.

---

## SPECIAL NOTES FOR WEEKS 9–12
- Difficulty should now be at **80–85% understanding** — challenge yourself.
- Avoid subtitles in your native language completely.
- Retelling should feel more fluid; accept mistakes but keep talking.
- Choose topics you enjoy — food, travel, culture — for motivation.
