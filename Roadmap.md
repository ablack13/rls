This file gives a compact month-by-month roadmap with measurable milestones and recommended activities.

## Roadmap overview (compact)
| Month | Weeks | Focus | Success criteria (end of month) |

| 1 | 1–4 | Foundations: sounds, 200–300 words, listening habits | Recognize/produce Romanian sounds; understand 30–40% slow input |
| 2 | 5–8 | Core vocabulary expansion; sentence chunks | 400–600 words; short retell 1–2 min |
| 3 | 9–12 | Transition to authentic input with visual support | Understand 50–60% of slow native speech; 3–5 min speaking |
| 4 | 13–16 | Improve speed & accuracy; structured output | 5–7 min continuous speech; follow short native videos |
| 5 | 17–20 | Strengthen comprehension & connectives | Understand normal-speed on familiar topics; 8–10 min speech |
| 6 | 20–24 | Consolidation & SRS; narrative production | Solid recall of 1000+ words; paragraph-level speaking |
| 7 | 25–28 | Fluency polishing; discourse markers | 12–15 min spontaneous speech; good handling of everyday topics |

## How to read the roadmap
- **Weekly files** contain day-by-day actionable tasks.
- Use `Checkpoints.md` for self-evaluations at the end of each stage.
- Keep a simple log (10–20 lines per day) with: input consumed, active speaking practice, SRS cards reviewed.

---

## Recommended weekly rhythm (summary)
- **Mon–Fri:** Input + active production focused on weekly theme.
- **Sat:** Longer listening/reading + speaking practice (tandem or shadowing).
- **Sun:** Review (SRS), record a 3–15 min speaking sample and self-assess.

---

## Resource suggestions (examples)
- Use a picture-based SRS deck (create your own).
- Short children’s videos — for Month 1.
- Topic-based podcasts and short news videos — for Months 3–8.
- Romanian subtitles: start with subtitles for support, remove them progressively.
