# 🇷🇴 Romanian B1 Roadmap — 6 Months (No Translation)

## Philosophy
- Learn naturally — **no direct translation**.
- Comprehension + speaking first, grammar via patterns.
- Use **listening, reading, and speaking daily**.
- **4 daily sessions** (total ~2h), no skipping days.
- Use **SRS with images/phrases** (no Anki-type apps).
- Time slots:  
  **08:00–08:30** | **13:30–14:00** | **18:00–19:00** | **21:30–22:00**
