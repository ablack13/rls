---

## DAILY SCHEDULE

### **08:00–08:30 AM — High-speed Listening**
- Watch 8–10 min of **fast interviews, debates, or lively talk shows** (Antena 3, Digi24, street interviews, or entertainment panels).
- **Weeks 29–30:** Summarize aloud in **under 90 seconds**.  
- **Weeks 31–32:** Cut down to **under 60 seconds** — aim for speed over perfection.

---

### **13:30–14:00 PM — Mixed Input**
- **Day A**: Read a short story or news article → Summarize orally.
- **Day B**: Listen to 5–6 min of radio → Write 3 key sentences from memory.  
  *(Once or twice a week, expand these into a 50–60 word paragraph to keep written Romanian sharp.)*
- Alternate each day.

---

### **18:00–19:00 PM — B1 Test Simulation**
- **Mon/Wed/Fri**: Simulate full oral exam:
  1. Picture description.
  2. Q&A with follow-ups.
  3. Monologue on a given topic.  
  *(Rotate topics and add an “unexpected twist” question each time.)*
- **Tue/Thu/Sat**: 20 min listening → 10 min retelling → 10 min free conversation.
- **Sun**: Mock “citizenship interview” with unpredictable questions.

---

### **21:30–22:00 PM — Light Closure**
- Watch a favorite Romanian YouTuber (comedy, vlogs, personal stories).
- Pick 3 expressions and reuse them in a sentence aloud before bed.

## End of Stage 8 Outcome:
- Understand ~90% of everyday spoken Romanian without subtitles.  
- Speak comfortably for 10–15 minutes on familiar topics without hesitation.  
- Confidently pass a B1 oral exam and handle citizenship interview questions naturally.  
- Recognize that **political debates and abstract topics** may still be ~80% comprehension — continue occasional exposure for growth.
