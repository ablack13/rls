**Goal:** spread practice across multiple focused short sessions to reduce fatigue and improve retention.

## Short day (45–60 min) — if you’re busy
| Slot | Duration | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Morning | 15–20 min | Short listening + SRS |
| Midday | 15–20 min | Quick reading + retell (1 minute) |

## Tips
- **Always** do SRS (5–10 min) in at least one slot.
- Use the deep slot for new and slightly difficult input.
- Keep a small notebook (physical or digital) with daily targets and 1 sentence goal per slot.
