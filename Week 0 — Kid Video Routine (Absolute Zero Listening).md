# 🇷🇴 Week 0 — Kid Video Routine (Absolute Zero Listening)

## 🎯 Goal
To start recognizing Romanian **sounds** and **patterns** before understanding words, using kid-friendly video content.

---

## 📌 Why This Works
- Kids’ videos are slow, repetitive, and visually obvious.
- You can link sounds to actions without translation.
- Builds **listening comfort** and **pronunciation muscle memory**.

---

## 🗓 Daily Routine (5–10 min)

### **Step 1 — Pick the right video**
- Length: **1–2 minutes** max.
- Content: Highly visual (e.g., “Peppa Pig” in Romanian, short kids songs, simple cartoon clips).
- Avoid: Anything with rapid dialogue or complicated topics.

---

### **Step 2 — Watch for actions, not words**
- First viewing: Focus on *what happens*, not on speech.
- Example: A character drops a ball → you hear *"minge"* → your brain starts linking that sound to the object.

---

### **Step 3 — Spot repetition**
- Listen for **phrases that come back** in different episodes.
- Even without knowing meaning, your brain will tag them as important.

---

### **Step 4 — Shadow without meaning**
- Repeat *any* words or sounds you catch clearly.
- Match the rhythm and intonation exactly, even without knowing what you’re saying.

---

### **Step 5 — Rewatch**
- Watch the same clip the next day.
- Try to anticipate some sounds before they are spoken.
- Celebrate if you can “hear” more details than on Day 1.

---

## 💡 Tips
- Keep it **fun** — don’t force understanding yet.
- Use this routine as an “ear warm-up” before any other study.
- Save favorite clips in a playlist so you can return and notice your progress.

---

**Outcome after 1–2 weeks:**  
You will start feeling *familiarity* with certain sounds and phrases, even without formal study — making all later listening MUCH easier.
