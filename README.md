# 🇷🇴 8-Month Romanian B1 Plan — Full No-Translation Approach

---

## 🎯 Key Rules
1. **No direct translation** — words are learned from pictures, sounds, context.
2. **Monolingual input only** — videos, audio, and text are all in Romanian.
3. **Grammar from context** — patterns are noticed, not memorized.
4. **Repetition without boredom** — revisit old materials in cycles.
5. **Daily exposure** — 4 sessions, total ~2.5h per day.
