## Core rules
1. **No direct translation.** Learn words from pictures, contexts, and examples.
2. **Monolingual input.** Use Romanian audio/video/text only.
3. **Grammar from context.** Notice patterns; donâ€™t start with grammar rules.
4. **Spaced repetition & variety.** Revisit content in cycles.
5. **Daily exposure.** Aim for ~2.5 hours/day split into focused micro-sessions.
