## DAILY SCHEDULE

---

### **08:00–08:30 AM — Fast Listening Warm-up**
**Mon/Wed/Fri**
- Listen to a **full news segment or interview clip** at normal speed:
  - [TVR Info — Știrile Zilei](https://tvrinfo.ro/)
- First listen: grasp main points.
- Second listen: note 5 keywords and try to recall full details without replaying.

**Tue/Thu/Sat/Sun**
- 5–6 min of **unscripted street interviews** or **event coverage**:
  - Search “reportaj România” on YouTube.
- Practice summarizing in 2–3 sentences immediately after.

---

### **13:30–14:00 PM — Reading for Argument + Summary**
**Daily**
- Read short but **argument-heavy** opinion pieces:
  - [HotNews.ro Opinii](https://www.hotnews.ro/opinii)
- Highlight connector words and rhetorical devices.
- Summarize both the author’s view and your own counterpoint in Romanian.

---

### **18:00–19:00 PM — Full B1 Simulation**
**Weeks 21–22**
- Simulate full listening + speaking exam:
  1. **Listening** — watch/listen to 8–10 min of mixed-speed Romanian audio, answer comprehension questions you create yourself.
  2. **Speaking** — describe picture, answer 3–4 questions, give a short monologue.
- Use a timer to match B1 exam constraints.

**Weeks 23–24**
- Alternate days:
  - **Day A**: Watch a 15–20 min authentic video without subtitles → retell with max detail.
  - **Day B**: Roleplay unpredictable scenarios (“You lost your wallet in Bucharest”, “Your neighbor invites you to a traditional event”).

---

### **21:30–22:00 PM — Calm Cool-down + Micro-Review**
**Daily**
- Relaxed listening: Romanian podcast, film, or music lyrics (no translation).
- Mental recall: pick one event from your day and narrate it in past tense.
- Review 5–8 key SRS cards, focusing on fluid pronunciation.

---

## WEEKLY REVIEW LOOP
- Continue SRS, now with **300–400 cards** total — retire easy ones, add only essential new phrases.
- Record yourself speaking for 5–10 min weekly — listen back and note improvements or recurring errors.

---

## SPECIAL NOTES FOR WEEKS 21–24
- Avoid last-minute grammar cramming — your brain will work better with pattern reinforcement from real content.
- If the B1 oral includes a picture description, practice with random Google Images daily.
- Keep some fun input (comedy sketches, favorite YouTubers) so motivation stays high.
- Walk into the test as if it’s just another day of your Romanian life — not an exam.
