# 🇷🇴 Romanian — Weeks 25–28 (Stage 7: Fluency Consolidation)

## Focus:
- Slow down vocabulary intake to focus on **active recall** and **automatic sentence building**.
- Transition from “study mode” to “live in Romanian” as much as possible.
- Increase spontaneous conversation practice.

---

## DAILY SCHEDULE

### **08:00–08:30 AM — Native-speed Immersion**
- Alternate daily between:
  - **TVR1 Morning News** (no subtitles)
  - Short **street interview compilations** (search “reportaj” + “România”)
- Goal: catch at least 80% of the main ideas without pausing.

---

### **13:30–14:00 PM — Targeted Reading**
- Choose *one* topic and stick with it for a week (e.g., Romanian cuisine, history, travel).
- Read **short online articles** or blog posts.
- Retell to yourself immediately in Romanian.

---

### **18:00–19:00 PM — Extended Conversation Practice**
- **3x/week**: Online language exchange or speaking with a Romanian friend.
- **2x/week**: Describe a video, film scene, or event in real time (like a live sports commentary).
- **2x/week**: Roleplay daily life scenarios (“ordering in a restaurant”, “asking for help in a store”).

---

### **21:30–22:00 PM — Relaxed Wrap-up**
- Listen to a Romanian podcast episode you enjoy (comedy, culture, personal stories).
- Write down *one* sentence you liked and reuse it in your speech tomorrow.
