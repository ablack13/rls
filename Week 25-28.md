## Tips for Success
- **No pausing** during listening — your brain must keep up.  
- If something is hard, **repeat the same content next day**, not slow it down.  
- Keep a **daily log** of 3–5 words or phrases you naturally pick up — don’t force memorization.  
- Speak every day, even if just to yourself, describing your environment.
