## WEEKLY REVIEW LOOP
- **Day 1 content → review Day 3 → review Day 7 → review Day 30** using same resource.

## SPECIAL NOTES FOR WEEKS 5–8
- Keep difficulty around **70–80% understanding** — don’t try to “get” everything.
- Visual context is king: always choose videos where you can see actions.
- Retelling aloud is your main active speaking exercise.
