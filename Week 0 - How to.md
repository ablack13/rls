# 🇷🇴 Week 0 — How to Start Learning Romanian Naturally (No Translation)

## 🎯 Goal
Build a foundation for Romanian entirely through **natural exposure**, without relying on translations.  
We’ll create a mental environment where Romanian becomes **familiar before it becomes “understood”**.

---

## 📌 Principles
1. **Comprehension before production** — Just like children, you’ll listen and watch before speaking much.
2. **No direct translation** — Learn meaning from context, visuals, and repetition.
3. **Frequent, short sessions** — Many micro-exposures daily are better than one long session.
4. **Focus on patterns, not single words** — Notice repeated chunks of language.
5. **Visual + audio pairing** — Always tie sound to an image or situation, never to your native language.

## 🕒 Suggested Daily Structure

### **Morning (10–15 min) — Pure Listening**
- Watch a short Romanian kids’ show (e.g., *TraLaLa*, *PitiClic*, *Povesti pentru copii*).
- **Don’t** pause or try to understand everything.
- Just notice repeated sounds and expressions.

---

### **Midday (10–15 min) — Listen & Watch Again**
- Replay the same video from the morning.
- This time, try to spot **the same words** you heard earlier.
- Optional: use **gestures** to mimic what’s happening in the video (this links meaning physically).

---

### **Afternoon (15–20 min) — Story Time**
- Listen to a short illustrated story (*Povesti Audio* on YouTube).
- Follow the images while listening.
- Point to the object or action you think the word matches.

---

### **Evening (5–10 min) — Passive Listening**
- Put on Romanian audio (radio, background YouTube, music) while doing another activity.
- Don’t focus — let the rhythm and melody of the language sink in.

---

## 🧠 Extra Tips
- **Rewatch the same content for a week** before moving to new material — this builds deep familiarity.
- Keep a **“sounds I know” list** — write down words/phrases you recognize **from sound alone**.
- Smile and enjoy it — emotional connection improves memory.
- Don’t test yourself yet — your only job is to *notice* and *enjoy*.

---

## ✅ End of Week 0 Outcome
- You will **recognize** at least 20–30 common Romanian words/phrases from sound alone.
- You will feel comfortable hearing Romanian without needing instant meaning.
- Your brain will be “tuned” for faster understanding in later weeks.
