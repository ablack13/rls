# The SRS Approach

This guide explains how to use Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) for learning Romanian naturally, without translations.

---

## 1. Goal
To recall new words and phrases more effectively by reviewing them at optimally spaced intervals, while keeping immersion as the primary method.

---

## 2. What You Need
- **An SRS app** (Anki, Mochi, Memrise, or any app that allows custom cards)
- **Screenshots** from your videos/stories
- **Audio** (can be recorded from the content or extracted with tools)

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Encounter
Watch or read your Romanian material (video, vlog, story). When you notice a new or unclear word:
- Pause the content
- Try to understand from context without translation

### Step 2: Capture
- Take a **screenshot** from the video or find an image that represents the moment.
- Write down the **exact Romanian sentence** containing the word.

### Step 3: Create the SRS Card
**Front side:**
- The Romanian word in large text
- The screenshot
- (Optional) Audio of the word

**Back side:**
- The full Romanian sentence with the word
- Another screenshot or short clip if possible
- (Optional) Audio of the sentence

_No translations!_

### Step 4: Review
- Spend **5–10 minutes daily** reviewing your cards.
- The SRS app will show you cards just before you’re likely to forget them.

## 4. Where It Fits in Your Routine
Example with your 4 daily sessions:
- **Morning (8:00–8:30)** — Review yesterday’s SRS cards before watching/listening.
- **Afternoon (1:30–2:00)** — Create new SRS cards from today’s material.
- **Evening sessions (6:00–7:00, 9:30–10:00)** — Focus on fresh input, no SRS.

---

## 5. Tips
- Keep cards simple — 1 new word or phrase per card.
- Use images and audio for stronger memory.
- Don’t overload yourself — max 10 new cards/day for beginners.
- The goal is **understanding through context**, not memorizing isolated lists.

---

## 6. Benefits
- Natural recall without translation.
- Reinforcement of words in real contexts.
- Long-term retention with minimal effort.

Happy learning!
