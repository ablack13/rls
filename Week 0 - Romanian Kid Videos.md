# ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ Week 0 â€” Romanian Kid Video Immersion

**Purpose**  
Start building listening comfort and soundâ€“meaning mapping using very short, highly visual childrenâ€™s videos. This is *listening-first*: do not translate, do not take notes â€” just expose, repeat, enjoy.

---

## How to Use This (5â€“30 min / day)

1. **Pick 1 short clip (1â€“3 min)** â€” same clip for several days in a row.
2. **Watch without pausing or translating.** Focus on visuals and actions.
3. **Imitate out loud** (shadowing) â€” copy rhythm and intonation even if you donâ€™t know the words.
4. **Rewatch next day** and try to anticipate sounds before they occur.
5. Keep sessions short and daily.

## Concrete Micro-Routines

Pick one for each slot:

- **Morning (5â€“10 min):** watch the main clip 1Ã— (listen-only).
- **Midday (5â€“10 min):** watch again and shadow short phrases.
- **Evening (5â€“10 min):** passive listening while doing another task.

## Zero-Level Tips

- **No dictionaries** in Week 0 â€” donâ€™t look up words.
- **Repetition > variety** â€” stick with same clips for 5â€“7 days.
- **Use gestures** and point to objects on screen â€” link sound â†’ image â†’ action.
- **Keep it fun** â€” if a clip bores you, switch to a more visual one.

---

## Expected Outcome After Week 0

- Comfortable hearing Romanian for short periods.
- Recognition of 15â€“30 recurring sounds/phrases (without translation).
- Ability to shadow very short chunks of speech with improved prosody.
