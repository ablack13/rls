## DAILY SCHEDULE

---

### **08:00–08:30 AM — Fast + Varied Listening**
**Mon/Wed/Fri**
- Watch 5–7 min of a **Romanian news magazine show**:
  - [Stirile Pro TV — România, te iubesc!](https://stirileprotv.ro/)
- Focus on understanding the story without visual aids (listen once with eyes closed, once with video).

**Tue/Thu/Sat/Sun**
- Short unscripted interviews from YouTube:
  - Search “interviu pe stradă România” or “vox populi România”
- Note 3–5 interesting expressions — repeat aloud.

---

### **13:30–14:00 PM — Reading + Speed Retelling**
**Daily**
- Read short opinion or commentary pieces:
  - [Digi24 Opinie](https://www.digi24.ro/opinii)
- Read once for gist, then again focusing on connectors (de exemplu, cu toate acestea, pe de altă parte).
- Retell the argument without looking, using connectors to link ideas.

---

### **18:00–19:00 PM — Deep Speaking + Listening Challenge**
**Weeks 17–18**
- Choose a 12–15 min authentic video (documentary, vlog, or interview).
- First 5–7 min: listen without stopping, get the main points.
- Next: replay in short segments, shadow natural speed.
- End: retell in detail, adding your own opinion.

**Weeks 19–20**
- Roleplay complex B1 tasks:
  1. **Problem-solving**: “Ce ai face dacă…?”
  2. **Opinion debate**: give your view, then argue the opposite view.
  3. **Past narration**: tell a real or imaginary story in past tense.

---

### **21:30–22:00 PM — Light Review + Mental Recall**
**Daily**
- 10–15 min passive listening: Romanian radio, TV talk, or audiobook.
- 5–10 min mental “day in review” — talk to yourself about the day’s events in Romanian.
- Brief SRS review of 5–10 images (long phrases preferred).

---

## WEEKLY REVIEW LOOP
- Keep SRS image-based review, now with 250–350 slides.
- Begin merging related phrases into **mini dialogues** for natural recall.

---

## SPECIAL NOTES FOR WEEKS 17–20
- This is the phase where confidence can dip — ignore perfectionism, focus on communication.
- Use background listening during chores (low-intensity exposure adds up).
- Practice both *speaking to be understood* and *speaking to sound natural*.
- Treat mistakes as data — repeat the corrected form immediately after you notice it.
